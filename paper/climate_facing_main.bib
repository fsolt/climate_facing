@article{Nagel2022,
	abstract = {In this Perspective, we argue that much climate change research conflates ``gender'' with ``women.''  We ask, what are the consequences of this conflation, and what do we learn when we follow sociologist George Homan's (1964) classical command to ``bring men back in'' to our analysis of the gendered dimensions of climate change?  We find, first, that scholarship on gender and climate change tends to depict women mainly as victims of the uneven impacts of climate change.  While this assessment is accurate on its face, it leads to solutions that address the problem (women's troubles), not its causes (men's greater responsibilities and failures relating to climate change).  We note that researchers' focus on women's suffering diverts attention from a thorough examination of the mechanisms and consequences of men's domination of climate change research and policy. We find, further, that analysts' gender/women conflation hinders redress of women's injuries by camouflaging men's blameworthiness and offering solutions that often increase women's duties.  Gender researchers' emphasis on women's plight and inequality obscures the exception that proves the rule:  men wield the (sometimes) invisible hands that create and perpetuate the climate crisis at the expense of everyone, including women. In this Perspective, we acknowledge women's relative vulnerability to climate change, outline in some detail the role of men and masculinity in the climate crisis, and identify the unique strengths that women and men each bring to the table to address the environmental challenges facing humanity.},

@article{Watsford2008,
	abstract = {Speeding is the biggest road safety problem in NSW and young male drivers are significantly over represented in speeding related crashes. This is not an emerging trend; it has been the case for decades. This is despite the introduction of new technology to help detect and penalize speeding drivers, targeted legislation, improved vehicle safety features and education campaigns to ensure drivers are aware of and understand the dangers of speeding. In 2007 the RTA adopted a new approach to make contact with a traditionally difficult to reach target audience (young men) with an anti speeding message that would have an impact on their attitudes, beliefs and motivate behavior change. The 'Pinkie' campaign 'Speeding. No one thinks big of you' has not only broken through the youth barrier but has been embraced by popular youth culture. Amazingly the campaign has generated worldwide interest, confirming that young male speeding drivers are a global problem and that the campaign has adopted a unique approach. The campaign has won industry awards and gained unparalleled media exposure but most importantly it has combined with other anti speeding initiatives to help significantly reduce speeding related fatalities in NSW. The campaign was extensively researched during its development and subsequent campaign tracking confirms the methodology was on target. The Pinkie campaign has introduced a new paradigm into road safety marketing in Australia.Keywords: Speeding, young male drivers, behaviour and cultural change<p />},

@article{Walker2000,
	abstract = { Gender differences are an important feature of road injury and death, with male youth particularly vulnerable. Yet road safety education lacks an adequate way of understanding and responding. Cultural constructions of masculinity are central to the problem. We draw on a literature search focused on boys and road safety education and an ethnographic study of young men and car culture to show how attachment to risk-laden car culture, which emphasizes masculine powers and excludes women, is attractive to working-class youth marginalized by mainstream schooling. Educational responses may draw on the plurality of masculinities and the interactive character of gender and must consider the cultural, gender, and class practices of teachers. },

@article{Smith2015,
	abstract = {Cross-national survey research is a complex and challenging endeavor. Designing a reliable and valid comparative study is notably more difficult than constructing a single monolingual/monocultural survey. Besides the whole array of components that encompass total-survey error in one survey, there is a parallel set of comparison errors that apply in cross-national surveys. Likewise, comparative analysis is complicated by these comparison errors, and even well-conducted comparative surveys may produce erroneous results due to failing to achieve functional equivalence at the design, collection, and/or analysis stages. Even locating cross-national data for secondary analysis can be a challenge. This note describes some valuable resources, especially those available on the web, which can assist in conducting cross-national survey research.},

	abstract = {Risks tend to be judged lower by men than by women and by white people than by people of colour. Prior research by Flynn, Slovic and Mertz {$[$}Risk Analysis, 14, pp. 1101-1108{$]$} found that these race and gender differences in risk perception in the United States were primarily due to 30{\%} of the white male population who judge risks to be extremely low. The specificity of this finding suggests an explanation in terms of sociopolitical factors rather than biological factors. The study reported here presents new data from a recent national survey conducted in the United States. Although white males again stood apart with respect to their judgements of risk and their attitudes concerning worldviews, trust, and risk-related stigma, the results showed that the distinction between white males and others is more complex than originally thought. Further investigation of sociopolitical factors in risk judgements is recommended to clarify gender and racial differences.},

@article{Bord1997,
	abstract = {Objective. Surveys demonstrate somewhat consistent gender differences in environmental concern, but there is no consensus on reasons for these differences. This research makes the case that differences in perceived vulnerability to risk explain the gender gap found in environmental surveys and other, quite distinct, areas of potential risk as well. Methods. Two national surveys, administered simultaneously and each involving very different environmental risks (hazardous waste sites and global warming), are analyzed in terms of gender differences. Results. In both surveys, in every question that involves reactions to a specific risk, women are more concerned than men. Standard deviations also are consistently smaller for women. When health-risk perceptions enter equations accounting for environmental concerns, however, the gender gap disappears. Conclusions. Questionnaire items that imply specific risks tend to produce significant gender differences. These types of survey results can be construed as communication events in which respondents who feel vulnerable answer in ways that urge caution on policymakers.},

@article{Goodey1997,
	abstract = {The gendered stereotypes of `fearless male/fearful female' are not supported by the reality of complex and multiple identities and the shifting meanings of fear and fearlessness which are brought to and evolve from these identities. Referring to evidence from the author's own research, childhood and adolescence are put forward as crucial stages in identity development where one can begin to unpack the processes by which gendered meanings of fear and fearlessness become `fixed'. This paper argues that the image of the `fearless' male, from childhood onwards, is not a helpful one. The benefits to the male sex from taking on a `fearless' persona, alongside its negative social implications, are discussed with reference to hegemonic masculinity. Class and race are put forward as significant variables in the development of hegemonic masculinity's emotionally inarticulate persona and racism is highlighted as one of the ugliest expressions of exaggerated masculinity. The above is placed and developed within the theoretical context of the `hegemonic masculine biography'.},

@article{Claassen2020a,
	abstract = {Abstract It is widely believed that democracy requires public support to survive. The empirical evidence for this hypothesis is weak, however, with existing tests resting on small cross-sectional samples and producing contradictory results. The underlying problem is that survey measures of support for democracy are fragmented across time, space, and different survey questions. In response, this article uses a Bayesian latent variable model to estimate a smooth country-year panel of democratic support for 135 countries and up to 29 years. The article then demonstrates a positive effect of support on subsequent democratic change, while adjusting for the possible confounding effects of prior levels of democracy and unobservable time-invariant factors. Support is, moreover, more robustly linked with the endurance of democracy than its emergence in the first place. As Lipset (1959) and Easton (1965) hypothesized over 50 years ago, public support does indeed help democracy survive.},

@article{Krosnick2014,
	abstract = {In 2010 and 2011, highly visible national surveys documented frequent failure among the public, especially among Republicans, to acknowledge that Barack Obama was born in the United States. However, different questions yielded strikingly different results. The highest rate of partisan division was generated by a CBS/New York Times closed-ended question that included potentially leading introductory sentences. The smallest partisan gap in apparent misinformation was generated by an ABC News/Washington Post open-ended question that did not ask a follow-up that was needed to gauge public beliefs about whether Mr. Obama was born in the United States. This paper reviews the polls on birtherism and describes an experiment embedded in a nationally representative sample survey testing whether methodological features of these two questions might have distorted their results and caused the apparent discrepancy between them. A version of the closed-ended question including the leading introductory sentences yielded a much larger degree of apparent partisan division than did a version of the question without the introductory sentences. Following the open question with another question that clarified people's beliefs (asking about whether Hawaii was part of the United States at the time of Barack Obama's birth) did not alter the conclusions supported by that item about the accuracy of public understanding. This study therefore illustrates how different question wording caused different polls to produce notably different results and provides a caution about the use of potentially leading wording.},

	abstract = {Abstract How does terrorism affect citizens' political attitudes? Over the years, many scholars have tried to answer this question. This article performs a meta-analysis on this literature, reviewing about 325 studies conducted between 1985 and 2020 on more than 400,000 respondents. The findings confirm that terrorism is associated---to a small but significant extent---with outgroup hostility, political conservatism and rally-`round-the-flag effects. At the same time, the effects of terrorism vary widely, with studies on Islamist violence, conducted in the United States or Israel, and using cross-sectional data yielding stronger results on average. Finally, the review reveals remaining gaps in this field of study, including a lack of research on non-Islamist violence or conducted in non-Western contexts. Taken together, this meta-analysis consolidates existing evidence, determines which results hold across contexts, and identifies key gaps in our current knowledge. Its data can also be accessed interactively via a Shiny App.},

@article{Cheung2014,
	abstract = {Meta-analysis is an indispensable tool used to synthesize research findings in the social, educational, medical, management, and behavioral sciences. Most meta-analytic models assume independence among effect sizes. However, effect sizes can be dependent for various reasons. For example, studies might report multiple effect sizes on the same construct, and effect sizes reported by participants from the same cultural group are likely to be more similar than those reported by other cultural groups. This article reviews the problems and common methods to handle dependent effect sizes. The objective of this article is to demonstrate how 3-level meta-analyses can be used to model dependent effect sizes. The advantages of the structural equation modeling approach over the multilevel approach with regard to conducting a 3-level meta-analysis are discussed. This article also seeks to extend the key concepts of Q statistics, I2, and R2 from 2-level meta-analyses to 3-level meta-analyses. The proposed procedures are implemented using the open source metaSEM package for the R statistical environment. Two real data sets are used to illustrate these procedures. New research directions related to 3-level meta-analyses are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {A review of research findings and polling data about Americans' attitudes on climate change reveals a lack of meaningful long-term change in mass opinion. Instead, the structure of Americans' attitudes toward belief in climate change&apos;s existence, concern about its consequences, and demand for policy response is similar to that regarding many other issues in contemporary US politics: stability in aggregate opinion that masks partisan and ideological polarization enhanced by communications from elites. But features of the climate change problem elicit some distinctive determinants of opinion, including individuals' trust in science, risk processing, and personal experience. Although our review of the literature and data leaves us skeptical that majority opinion will spur elected officials anytime soon to undertake the costly solutions necessary to tackle this problem comprehensively at the national level, we identify several avenues by which attitudes might promote less substantial but nevertheless consequential policy action.},

@article{Ergun2024,
	abstract = {This study investigates the role of country-level and individual-level factors on climate change risk perception in 28 European countries. Based on the nature of the data and the research question, a multilevel ordered logit model is used. As individual observations are nested among countries, the data is hierarchical, justifying the use of a multilevel model. The analysis focuses on a dependent variable with ordered categories. Due to its inherent ordinal structure, the response levels convey a meaningful order. The ordered logit model explicitly considers this ordinal nature when modeling the dependent variable. On the country level, this study found that climate change risk perception rises with a higher level of income per capita and a lower level of regulatory quality. The positive effect of the national income level persists after controlling for whether the country had a communist regime past or not. On the individual level, this study found that a higher level of climate change risk perception is exhibited by more educated individuals, those with egalitarian and post-materialistic values, those with a higher interest in politics, and a lower level of personal economic worries. Overall, females express higher levels of climate change risk perception than males, but having younger children at home reduces females'risk perceptions. Similarly, climate change risk perception levels decrease with age only for women. A series of robustness checks validate the main findings. The research suggests that EU policymakers can enhance climate policies and public engagement by considering differences in income, regulatory quality, historical context, and gender-specific aspects. Insights from this study can guide targeted risk communication.},
